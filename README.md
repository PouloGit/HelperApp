The application is a work in progress.

I will update the repository with screenshots and path to the code when done.

In the current state, this is how the application looks like:

The "To-Do" tab is to leave notes on what to do on a certain day.

The "Notes" tab expands into a sub-menu containing 3 other buttons (Pages), can be used for notes on different topics.

The "Projects" tab is complete, should be working as intended, currently missing a database to store the information.

The "Help" tab will explain how the application works.

The "Settings" tab will have some UI settings and display settings.

The "Exit" button closes the application.
